# Tempo Estimation and Beat Tracking - Pipeline
A comprehensive pipeline for the Tempo Estimation and Beat Tracking MIR problem, implemented in Python on a Jupyter notebook.

# Local Run

Start Jupyter Lab and Server containers:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now you can open the notebook with a browser here: http://localhost:8888

An IDE (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_connect-to-a-remote-jupyter-server), tested) can also be used with this Jupyter server container URL: `http://localhost:8889?token=a`
